	TO DO
	
		The following tasks need to be done:
		
		* Implement String createDirectory(String pathName).
		* Implement usage of background tasks (provide job to server).
		* Implement listening to file events with asynchronous message inflow.
		* Add the possibility to configure the RA.
		* Write chapter on configuration in the README.
		* Add JUnit tests... (we need a file system mock to solve this, and a JCA driver).
		* Remove vendor-specifics (jonas-ra.xml).
		* Prefix for temporary files should be configurable by administrator.
		* Location for temporary files should be configurable by administrator.
		* Add logging to let administrator have a log what the RA did.
		* Add some buffering strategy but keep in mind transactions...! (e. g. BufferedOutputStream with configurable size / needs to flush)
		* Add the possibility to move and copy complete trees.
		* Add configuration property to let admin decide where to resolve relative paths.
		* Implement lazy reassociation of connection handles to support connection sharing.
